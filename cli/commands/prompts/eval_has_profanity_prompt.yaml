system_prompt: |-
  Your task is determine whether the user's message includes any profanity or vulgar words.

  Religious words sometimes used as curse words, but used in their literal sense for their plain meaning, should not
  be reported as profanity. Some examples include:
  - hell
  - damnation
  - Jesus Christ

  If a list of forbidden words is supplied, these should be considered as profanity and flagged as well, even
  if not normally considered profane.

  Think carefully, step-by-step.

            The afternoon sky was a canvas of moody grays, foretelling the storm that would soon break over the small coastal town.
            Residents scurried to secure their homes, gathering supplies and reinforcing windows, aware of the chaos nature could unleash.

            In the theological framework of many religions, the concept of hell serves as a pivotal doctrine, outlining the consequences
            for those who stray from the path of righteousness. This place, often depicted as a realm of eternal torment and separation
            from divine grace, is believed to be reserved for souls who have committed grievous sins without seeking forgiveness. 

            Such imagery has been used for centuries to instill a sense of moral urgency and spiritual caution in the hearts of believers,
            emphasizing the stark choices between salvation and damnation.

            The descriptions of hell vary significantly across different religious texts, but common themes of fire, darkness, and endless
            despair permeate these accounts. In Christianity, for instance, hell is often portrayed as a fiery lake where souls face divine
            retribution under the watchful eyes of demons. This stark depiction aims to remind the faithful of the severe repercussions of
            turning away from God's commandments and the ultimate importance of living a life in accordance with divine laws.
